## Description

sAIght is a Python-based application designed to assist individuals with visual impairments. It leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for object detection, providing real-time feedback about the surrounding environment.
sAight uses the camera feed from the user's device to continuously scan the environment. The AI model identifies and locates objects in the feed, and the application then provides audio feedback to the user based on these detections.
